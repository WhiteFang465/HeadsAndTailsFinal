>A game that tests your memory and recollection skills. This game involves a computer that generates a random 4-digit number and the role of the player is to guess that code. You have unlimited tries and as a plus point, you get hints from the computer on how close you are to guessing the code. This hint will disappear on your next guess so you need to remember them and get it right.
